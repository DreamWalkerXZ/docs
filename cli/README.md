# Command Line Interface

The command line interface is very extensive and you can use it to modify settings, users or even have a generator of File Browser installations. The main sub commands available are:

* `cmds` to manage the command runner.
* `config` to manage the configuration of the installation.
* `users` to manage your users.
* `import` to import from a 1.x configuration.
* `init` is an alias to `config init`.

Under this section you can find the usage of each command. This docs were automatically generated from the source code and have the same information as the `--help` \(shorthand `-h`\) flag.
