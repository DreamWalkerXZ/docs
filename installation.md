# Installation

File Browser is a single binary and can be used as a standalone executable. Although, some might prefer to use it with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/), which is a fantastic web server that enables HTTPS by default. It's installation is quite straightforward independently on which system you want to use.

## Quick Setup

The quickest way for beginners to start using File Browser is by opening your terminal and executing the following commands:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Unix" %}
```bash
curl -fsSL https://filebrowser.xyz/get.sh | bash
filebrowser -s /path/to/your/files
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Windows" %}
```bash
iwr -useb https://filebrowser.xyz/get.ps1 | iex
filebrowser -s /path/to/your/files
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Done! It will bootstrap a database in which all the configurations and users are stored. Now, you can see on your command line the address in which your instance is running. You just need to go to that URL and use the following credentials:

* Username: `admin`
* Password: `admin`

{% hint style="danger" %}
You must change the password and, if you can, the username for the best security possible.
{% endhint %}

Although this is the fastest way to bootstrap an instance, we recommend you to take a look at the possibility of options on [`init`]() and [`config set`](cli/filebrowser-config-set.md) to make the installation as safe and customized as it can be.

## Docker

File Browser is also available as a Docker image. You can find it on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/filebrowser/filebrowser). The tag "latest" is bond to master branch which may contain breaking changes so we recommend you to use a different tag with the latest version.

The usage is as follows:

```bash
docker run \
    -v /path/to/root:/srv \
    -v /path/filebrowser.db:/database.db \
    -v /path/.filebrowser.json:/.filebrowser.json \
    -p 80:80 \
    filebrowser/filebrowser
```

By default, we already have a [configuration file with some defaults](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser/blob/master/.docker.json) so you can just mount the root and the database. Although you can overwrite by mounting a directory to with a new config file.

## Caddy

File Browser was born as a [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) plugin. Caddy is a fantastic web server with automatic HTTPS. And despite its growth, we still ‚ù§ and support Caddy. It is available to download at their [download page](https://caddyserver.com/download), where you just need to select `http.filebrowser` on the plugins list.

```text
filebrowser [url] [scope] {
    database          path
    auth_method       method
    auth_header       header
    recaptcha_key     key
    recaptcha_secret  secret
    recaptcha_host    host
}    
```

* `url` is the URL path where you will access File Browser. Defaults to `/`.
* `path` is the database path where the settings will be stored.
* `method` is the [authentication method](configuration/authentication-method.md) you want to use.
* `header`, `key`, `secret` and `host` are specific options for each [authentication method](configuration/authentication-method.md).
