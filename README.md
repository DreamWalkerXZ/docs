Welcome to File Browser's official documentation. Here you can find probably anything you need to know about the configuration of your instance, the usage and the contributing guidelines. Are you ready to get into this boat? ðŸš¢

File Browser is a **create-your-own-cloud-kind** of software where you can install it on a server, direct it to a path and then access your files through a nice web interface. You have many available features such as:

* Managing your files.
* Search.
* Command execution \(you can execute `git`_,_ `hugo`_,_ `jekyll` or any other commands you want\).
* Having multiple users.

We focus on doing one thing, but doing it well. One of the crucial pieces of File Browser is our community which is always asking us for new features or reporting issues that might happen. We recommend you vividly to check our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser).
